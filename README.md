# LM Studio Nodes for ComfyUI

**Author:** Matt John Powell

This extension provides a suite of custom nodes for ComfyUI that deeply integrate LM Studio's capabilities using the official `lmstudio` Python SDK. It allows you to leverage locally run models for various generative tasks directly within your ComfyUI workflows.

The nodes offer functionalities including:

1.  **Unified Generation:** Generate text from text prompts, image prompts, or both combined.
2.  **Image to Text:** Generate detailed text descriptions of images using vision models.
3.  **Text Generation:** Generate text based on a given prompt using language models, with streaming support.
4.  **Model Management:** List available models, load models into memory with a TTL, and unload them.
5.  **Model Selection:** Dynamically select models based on type (LLM/Vision) and text filters.
6.  **Setup Assistance:** Helper node for SDK installation check, model listing, and download guidance.
7.  **Random List Picker:** Paste any newline-separated list of items and randomly select one or many each run — great for injecting random genres, styles, moods, subjects, or any variable into your prompts.

## Workflow Example

Here's an example of how the LM Studio nodes can be used in a ComfyUI workflow:

![LM Studio Nodes Workflow](workflow.png)
*(Ensure this image accurately reflects a workflow using the new nodes)*

## Features

-   Utilizes the official `lmstudio` Python SDK for robust connection and interaction.
-   Supports text-only, image-only (vision), and combined text+image inputs.
-   Identifies models using `model_key` strings (e.g., `llama-3.2-1b-instruct`).
-   Provides dedicated nodes for specific tasks (Image-to-Text, Text Generation).
-   Includes nodes for managing model memory (Load/Unload/List).
-   Offers a dynamic model selector node for easier workflow building.
-   Setup node provides guidance for installing the SDK and getting models.
-   Customizable system prompts for context setting.
-   Control over generation parameters like `max_tokens`, `temperature`, and `seed`.
-   **Thinking mode toggle** for hybrid reasoning models (Gemma 4, Qwen 3, …) — see [Thinking / Reasoning Mode](#thinking--reasoning-mode).
-   Optional streaming output for the Text Generation node.
-   Debug mode for detailed console logging.
-   Automatic connection to the LM Studio server (no need to specify IP/Port in nodes).
-   **Random List Picker** utility node for injecting randomness into prompts — supports weighted items, templates, multi-pick, shuffle, case control, exclusions, and reproducible seeds.

## Installation

1.  Navigate to your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` directory.
2.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/ComfyUI/custom_nodes
    git clone [https://github.com/mattjohnpowell/comfyui-lmstudio-nodes.git](https://github.com/mattjohnpowell/comfyui-lmstudio-nodes.git) ComfyExpo-LMStudioNodes
    # Using 'ComfyExpo-LMStudioNodes' as the directory name to avoid potential conflicts
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:** Ensure the `lmstudio` package is installed in ComfyUI's Python environment:
    ```bash
    # Activate your ComfyUI Python environment (if using venv, conda, etc.) first!
    pip install lmstudio
    ```

## Troubleshooting

### LM Studio Version Compatibility

If you encounter errors like:
- `Error processing with LM Studio: Object missing required field 'bosToken' - at '$.promptTemplate.jinjaPromptTemplate'`
- Other SDK-related errors after upgrading LM Studio

This usually means your LM Studio SDK version is incompatible with your LM Studio version. **Solution:**

1. **Quick Fix:** Run the upgrade helper script:
   ```bash
   python upgrade_lmstudio.py
   ```

2. **Manual Fix:** Upgrade the LM Studio SDK:
   ```bash
   pip install lmstudio --upgrade
   ```

3. **Restart ComfyUI completely** after upgrading.

### Backward Compatibility

The nodes now support backward compatibility with older workflow files that used:
- `model` parameter instead of `model_key`
- `ip_address` and `port` parameters for HTTP connections

When old parameters are detected, the nodes will:
- Show a deprecation warning
- Automatically use the legacy HTTP mode if `ip_address` and `port` are provided
- Map `model` parameter to `model_key` for SDK mode

**Recommendation:** Update old workflows to use the new SDK-based parameters for better performance and reliability.
    *(You might need to use a specific pip command depending on your ComfyUI setup, e.g., for portable builds)*
4.  Restart ComfyUI.

## Usage

Add the nodes to your workflow by right-clicking the canvas and searching for their names (e.g., "LM Studio Unified (Expo)").

---

### Random List Picker

A general-purpose utility node. Paste any newline-separated list of items and the node randomly selects one (or many) each time the workflow runs, then assembles a ready-to-use prompt string. No LM Studio connection required — works standalone.

**Inputs:**

| Input | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `items` | STRING (multiline) | sample genres | One item per line. Append `::weight` for weighted probability (e.g. `jazz::3` is 3× more likely than weight-1 items). |
| `template` | STRING (multiline) | *(empty)* | Prompt template using `{item}` as a placeholder, e.g. `"Create a {item} track with heavy bass."` Overrides prefix/suffix when non-empty. |
| `prefix` | STRING | *(empty)* | Text prepended before the chosen item(s). Used when `template` is empty. |
| `suffix` | STRING | *(empty)* | Text appended after the chosen item(s). Used when `template` is empty. |
| `exclude` | STRING (multiline) | *(empty)* | Items that must never be chosen, one per line (case-insensitive). |
| `fallback` | STRING | *(empty)* | Value returned when the list is empty after exclusions apply. |
| `count` | INT | 1 | Number of **unique** items to pick. Automatically capped at the list size. |
| `separator` | STRING | `, ` | String used to join multiple picked items. |
| `case` | COMBO | `original` | Case transformation: `original` \| `uppercase` \| `lowercase` \| `title` \| `sentence`. |
| `mode` | COMBO | `pick` | `pick` — choose random item(s). `shuffle` — return the entire list in a random order. |
| `seed` | INT | -1 | Random seed. `-1` = new random result every run; any other value = reproducible. |

**Outputs:**

| Output | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `selected_item` | STRING | The chosen item(s), joined with `separator`. |
| `prompt` | STRING | Fully assembled prompt (template or prefix + item + suffix). Wire this directly into any text input. |
| `item_count` | INT | Total usable items after exclusions. |
| `selected_index` | INT | Zero-based index of the first chosen item (`-1` in shuffle mode). |

**Example — random music genre prompt:**

```
items:
  rock
  pop
  jazz::3
  classical
  hip-hop

template:  Create a {item} song with a melancholic mood.
```

Each run the node draws a weighted-random genre and outputs something like:
`Create a jazz song with a melancholic mood.`

**Example — pick 3 unique styles:**

```
count: 3
separator: ", "
template: Generate artwork combining {item}.
```

Output prompt: `Generate artwork combining watercolour, impressionist, cyberpunk.`

## Thinking / Reasoning Mode

Hybrid reasoning models (Gemma 4, Qwen 3, and friends) can answer with or without an
internal thinking pass. The **LM Studio Unified**, **I2T**, **Text Gen**, and
**Structured Output** nodes each expose two optional inputs for this:

-   `thinking_mode` (`default` | `on` | `off`, default `default`)
-   `thinking_trigger` (STRING, default empty)

LM Studio's prediction API has no per-request reasoning switch, so `on`/`off` work the
way the models themselves do — by injecting the family's soft-switch token into the
**user** message (the system prompt does not reliably trigger it). The token is picked
from `model_key`:

| Model family | `on` | `off` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gemma*` | `<|think|>` prefix | no token (Gemma is non-thinking by default) |
| `qwen*` and anything else | ` /think` suffix | ` /no_think` suffix |

`default` leaves the prompt completely untouched, so whatever you have configured for
the model inside LM Studio wins. Set `thinking_trigger` to override the injected token
for a model the auto-detection doesn't know about; it replaces the token for whichever
mode is selected. Enable `debug` to see exactly what was injected.

Turning thinking on does not change the node's output format — `strip_thinking`
(default on) still removes the reasoning from the returned text, covering both
`<think>…</think>` blocks and Gemma's `<|channel>thought…<channel|>` output. Turn
`strip_thinking` off if you want the reasoning in the output string.

> **Gemma 4 note:** for the reasoning to be parsed out cleanly by LM Studio itself,
> also enable *Reasoning Parsing* in the model's settings (start string
> `<|channel>thought`, end string `<channel|>`). Without it the node falls back to
> stripping the block with a regex.

## LM Studio Setup

1.  Install and run [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) on your machine.
2.  Download desired models within LM Studio (ensure you have vision models for image tasks).
3.  Go to the "Server" tab (icon looks like `<->`) in LM Studio.
4.  Select a model to load and click **Start Server**.
5.  **The LM Studio server *must* be running** for these ComfyUI nodes to connect and function.

## Notes

-   These nodes use the official `lmstudio` Python SDK, which handles the connection to your running LM Studio server automatically (typically `localhost:1234`). There's no need to input IP/Port in the nodes themselves.
-   Use the `model_key` (found in LM Studio, e.g., `Org/ModelName-Format`) as the identifier in the `model_key` inputs.
-   The `seed` input allows for reproducible outputs. Set to -1 for a random seed on each run.

## SDK Usage

These nodes leverage the official `lmstudio` Python SDK, replacing the previous method of interacting via the OpenAI-compatible API endpoint directly. This provides more robust integration and access to SDK-specific features.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1.  Enable the `debug` input (set to True) on the relevant node(s).
2.  Check the ComfyUI console for error messages and detailed debug output from the nodes.
3.  Verify that the **LM Studio application is running** and the **Server has been started** with a model loaded.
4.  Ensure the `model_key` you are providing exists in your LM Studio library and is compatible with the node's task (e.g., a vision model for the I2T node).
5.  Confirm the `lmstudio` Python package is correctly installed in your ComfyUI environment.
